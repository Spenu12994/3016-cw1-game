Gameplay:

Freeroam -
Explore the open world using the WASD keys,
search for powerful crystals (p) to aid in your growth,
search through tall grass (M) to chance encounter dangerous enemies lurking through the reeds,
and use health stations (H) to recover from close victories.

Combat - When roaming tall grass you might encounter enemies... -
use A and D to navigate the menu (and e,f,or Enter to select) to choose between 3 Battle options:
[
Fight - 
	Attack an enemy,
	With precise swings you can hit critical points and deal additional damage to enemies!,
	when arrows appear on screen, use WASD or Arrow Keys to press in the same direction,
	successful swings will increase a multiplier that gets added to your final attack to deal bonus damage.

Special - 
	With your training and expertise, you can predict or immobilise enemies with ease,
	when activating your special, you will either decrease the enemy's attack power, or speed
	leaving them weakened to further attacks

Run - 	
	Sometimes a battle can be too much,
	by hitting run you can quickly flee the battle and recouperate health in order to try again.
	Be warned however, Some enemies will trap you on the battlefield leaving you unable to run,
	and wasting a turn trying to scurry.
]

Finishing a battle will reward you with EXP proportionate to the enemy's level, and Level up your Character.

Stats -

Every Creature in the shallow valley has 3 main stats:
{
Health - 
	the Hit Points a character has, decrease with successful attacks against them.
	if a creature's hitpoints are reduced to zero they are defeated!
	if this creature is you however...you will fail, being sent back to your most recent save.
Speed -
	A Creature's speed defines how swift it is in combat
	The Higher a creature's speed, the more likely it is to dodge incoming attacks.
Attack -
	The power of a creature's attack, dealing more damage to your hitPoints the higher the attack is.
}

These Stats increase as you level up, but the same is true for your enemies...
